# Welcome to the Swiss Trust Infrastructure Community

A project with such far-reaching implications as the undertaking to create the state electronic identity and an associated trust infrastructure for digital certificates requires a broad base of active and constructive contributors to the dialog. The project team looks forward to your participation!

## Public Beta Open Source Repositories

Following the preliminary implementation Roadmap (dependent on the legal process), the Swiss Trust Infrastructure is planned to go live with a full production roll out in 2026. A Public Beta environment is made available in early 2025, together with a pre-release environment to allow future participants from the public and private sector to prepare themselves for the final go live and provide feedback by contributing to the testing of the Swiss Trust Infrastrucure via already testing their use cases on it. The Open Source Code from Public Beta is available in the [different repositories](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/repositories).

## Slides of the participation meeting

Documents and presentations from all online meetings are made available in [this folder](../tree/main/meetings) by the project team. 

## Discussions

This repository combines discussions and questions on technology and governance topics related to the digital Swiss Trust Infrastructure in one place.
