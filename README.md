# Welcome to the Swiss Trust Infrastructure Community

A project with such far-reaching implications as the undertaking to create the state electronic identity and an associated trust infrastructure for digital certificates requires a broad base of active and constructive contributors to the dialog. The project team looks forward to your participation!

## Public Beta Open Source Repositories

Following the preliminary implementation Roadmap (dependent on the legal process), the Swiss Trust Infrastructure is planned to go live with a full production roll out in 2026. A Public Beta environment is made available in early 2025, together with a pre-release environment to allow future participants from the public and private sector to prepare themselves for the final go live and provide feedback by contributing to the testing of the Swiss Trust Infrastrucure via already testing their use cases on it. The Open Source Code from Public Beta is available in the [different repositories](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/repositories).

## Slides of the participation meeting

Documents and presentations from all online meetings are made available in [this folder](../tree/main/meetings) by the project team. 

## Discussions

This repository combines [discussions](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/community/discussions) and questions on technology, governance, and other topics related to the digital Swiss Trust Infrastructure in one place. Feel free to start a new discussion and select a category that best suits your topic.

## Documentation of the Swiss Trust Infrastructure

On the [swiyu docs website](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/) we provide a technical overview, deeper insights on standards and protocols as well as cookbooks for the onboarding to the different components of the Swiss e-ID trust infrastructure.

## Rules for all participants and community management procedures

All collaboration on the platform is subject to the GitHub [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service). We all work together to ensure a goal-oriented development and objective discussion. Doing so, we follow the [community guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines) and the corresponding code of conduct. These rules must always be adhered to. There is no place for personal interference in the discussions.

Please be aware that all content on this platform is public. This also applies to the sharing of data such as presentations or working papers: no author rights may be violated.

The community management reserves the right to give individual contributions more weight in order to draw attention to certain aspects. Similarly, contributions can be hidden or deleted by the community management to improve the quality of discussion threads.

Ultimately, the e-ID project is not bound by the input from this participation platform for the development and decision-making process for the implementation of the future state e-ID. All content on this platform is an informal exchange.
